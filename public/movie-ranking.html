<h1>The Best Movies According to Hana</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>There is a lot of excitement in the movie.</p>

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>The ending that men and women no longer be together because of their separate dreams but are happy with the success of each other is reasonable and moving at the same time.</p>

<h3>My intern</h3>
<p>You can see the beautiful friendship between a young powerful woman and older men who are very experienced. She learns work and life tips from him.</p>
